# Molecular Intelligence

A modular, extensible, Rust-first framework for computational chemistry and
molecular machine learning. The project targets the full path from molecular
representations to trained models and scientific evaluation, with an initial
research focus on molecular property prediction — HOMO, LUMO, and the
HOMO–LUMO gap.

## Current Status: Phase 3 — Scientific Dataset Layer

The workspace foundation (Phase 0), chemistry core (Phase 1, `mi-chemistry`),
and molecular graphs (Phase 2, `mi-graph`) are complete. `mi-data` now
provides validated, in-memory molecular datasets: entries pairing molecules
with optional electronic properties (HOMO, LUMO, HOMO–LUMO gap in eV via an
explicit `Energy` type), coverage/summary statistics, and on-demand graph
views. No file loaders, tensors, models, or training yet. See
[`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md),
[`docs/architecture/molecular-graph.md`](docs/architecture/molecular-graph.md),
and [`docs/architecture/dataset-layer.md`](docs/architecture/dataset-layer.md).

## Requirements

- Rust stable, **Edition 2024** (Rust 1.85 or newer) via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- Cargo (bundled with rustup)
- `rustfmt` (`rustup component add rustfmt`)

## Crates

| Crate            | Kind | Intended Responsibility |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| `mi-core`        | lib  | Shared types, errors, and foundational abstractions. |
| `mi-chemistry`   | lib  | Molecular and atomic representations. **Implemented (Phase 1):** elements, atoms, bonds, molecules, structural validation. |
| `mi-graph`       | lib  | Molecular graph representations. **Implemented (Phase 2):** molecular graphs, feature schemas, adjacency, molecule-to-graph conversion. |
| `mi-data`        | lib  | Dataset loading and data processing. **Implemented (Phase 3):** validated in-memory molecular datasets with HOMO/LUMO/gap properties and statistics. |
| `mi-tensor`      | lib  | Numerical and tensor abstractions. |
| `mi-models`      | lib  | Machine learning model definitions. |
| `mi-training`    | lib  | Training infrastructure. |
| `mi-evaluation`  | lib  | Scientific evaluation and metrics. |
| `mi-inference`   | lib  | Model inference. |
| `mi-python`      | lib  | Future Python interoperability layer. |
| `mi-cli`         | bin  | Command-line interface. |

These responsibilities are declarations of intent; `mi-chemistry` (Phase 1),
`mi-graph` (Phase 2), and `mi-data` (Phase 3) are implemented, and the rest
remains future work.

## Architecture

Dependencies between crates point strictly downward through the layers
`interface → ML lifecycle → domain/data → core`; details, rationale, and the
planned Rust/Python boundary are documented in
[`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md).

## Quality Checks

```bash
cargo metadata --no-deps       # Workspace manifest sanity
cargo check --workspace        # Type-check every crate
cargo fmt --all -- --check     # Verify formatting
```

## Conventions

- All crates inherit shared metadata (`version`, `edition`, `rust-version`,
  `license`) from the root `[workspace.package]` section.
- Scientific logic lives in domain crates; infrastructure lives in
  `mi-tensor`/`mi-training`/`mi-inference`; `mi-cli` and `mi-python` are
  composition roots and contain no scientific logic.
- Large research artifacts (dataset files, checkpoints) are not committed;
  see `.gitignore`.
